First install dependencies: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

To use this:

Drop 'zifbin' in your $PATH, and do 'zifbin < ./path/to/myfile'. Run
'zifbin -h' for other options.

Drop .zifbin.rc in $HOME, edit as needed. If you hate polluting your
home directory, XDG base directory is also supported; try
'~/.config/zifnab/config.rc'.
